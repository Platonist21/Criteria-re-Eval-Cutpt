   abstract = {After tier 1 and 2 cut points for anti-drug antibody (ADA) assays are derived during pre-study assay validation in a population, there is a need to verify the continued appropriateness of the previously derived cut points during sample analysis in the same or different populations, per FDA guidance (US HHS, FDA, CDER, CBER, 2019). Proper sample sizeâ€“dependent criteria with statistical underpinning were derived and presented in this technical note to aid in assessing the appropriateness of tier 1 and tier 2 cut points, respectively.},
